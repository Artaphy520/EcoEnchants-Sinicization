# Table chance is the chance of getting enchantment as a percentage from an enchanting table
# Minimum Level is the minimum xp level you have to be to get the enchantment
# You can add more rarities by following the pattern.
# Remember, enchantments are more likely to be high-level the closer they are to maximum-obtainable-level
# Villager chance is the chance of a villager having this trade as a percentage. Vanilla default for all enchantments is 2.7%, however you can choose this per-rarity.
# Loot chance is the chance of an item in a loot chest having this enchantment as a percentage
